What is java? 
Java is high level, robust, object oriented and secure programming language.
java was develop by Sun Microsystems
Robust means better or strong memory management.
It is open Source and free
java is most used langauage in industry

Application of Java:
Mobile Application
Web Application: JSP, Spring, Hibernate, etc
Games
Destop Application

JDK: Java Development Kit
JRE: Java Runtime Environment + Development tools eg: javac
JVM: Java Virtual Machine + libraries and Other files
Source Code(.java) --> Compiler --> byte code(.class) --> JVM --> Native Code(low or machine level language)
.class is the byte code which was generated by after the complilation

Comment in Java: 
//--Single line comment--//
/*-- Multiple line comment --*/

Primitive Datatype: 
Data type in java:
byte : 1 byte
short : 2 byte
int : 4 byte
long : 8 byte in long we use l at the end of interger
float: 4 byte in float we use f at the end of integer
double: 8 byte in double we use d at the end of integer
char: 2 byte
bollean: 1byte


Non-Primitive Datatype: String, class, array, object, interface

----->Arithmatic operators: this is normal mathematical operator 
Binary: +, - , *, /, %. 
/ = use for divison
% = modulo which is use for remainder
In binary their are two operands

Unary: ++, --
In unary their are one operands
a++ is a = a + 1; this is increment operator
a-- is a = a - 1; this is decrement operator

----->Relational Operators: this operator is use for find then relation between variables
== equal to equal to
!= not equal to
>  greater
<  smaller
>= greater than equal to
<= smaller than equal to

----->Logical Operators: 
&& (Logical AND) here both statemant has to been true 
|| (Logical OR)  here both or any one has to been true
!  (Logical NOT)

T T - T
T F - F
F T - F
F F - F

T T - T
T F - T
F T - T
F F - F

True -> False
False-> True

Both are same 
A = A + 10;
A += 10;
B = B - 5;
B -= 5


///Function///
What is Function:
Function is basically is block of code which perform particullar task. it is reusable

In java programs there is one function is always present which was is main function which type is void which mean is hollow or empty
eg- public static void main(String arg[]){
    //body//
}
here the public static is access modifier
void is return type 
main is function

function store in stack format. at the bottom there is main function then there is function which is we created for call.
java Funtion work on call by value because its pass duplicate value. but Java does not use call by reference it pass original value.

Funtion Overloading: Multiple Function with the same name but different parameter(parameter in term of dataype or in term of no of parameter) overloading does not depends on return type


Decimal number is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
binary number is 0,1.

java is zero index base language therefore it always start with index 0;
