OOP: Object Oriented Progarmming

what is classes: the classes is the collection of objects 
what is object: the object is the real world entity like a pen, student, etc.
eg:
//the name of class should be start with the captial letter and in function we start the function name with the small letter
class Student{
    String name;
    int roll;

    void Setname(Student s1){
        this.name = name;
    }
}    

Access modifier/specifier: (isse pata chalega ki konsa data kisi accessible hoga)
 there are three type of Access modifier
 Default: with in class and within the package
 Public: all and outside of package
 Protected: with in class, within packages and outside package by subclass only
 private: only with in class

 Get: to return the value:getters
 Set: to modify the value:setters  
 this: this keyword is used to refer to the current object. 

 Constructors:
 constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.

 .constructor have the same name as class or structure.
 .constructor don't have a return type.(not even void)
 .constructor are only called once, at object creation.
 .Memory allocation happens when constructor is called.
 
 eg: Pen p1 = new Pen(); //here the Pen() is constructor.

 there are three type of constructor
 non-parameterized 
 parameterized
 copy parameterized

 constructor overloading: multiple function with a same name but different in argument or no of arrgument.

it also implements data hiding.

the basic meaning of encaplation is wrapping up a data and method into a single entities

Inheritance: Inheritance is when properties and methods of base class are passed on to a derived class.
type of the Inheritance:
1)Single
2)Multilevel
3)hierarchical

Polymorphism:
